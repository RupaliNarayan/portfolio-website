# Hello, I'm Rupali

## Data Analyst & Data Scientist

I transform complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive business decisions. With expertise in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, I help organizations unlock the hidden value in their data.

### Featured Projects

#### Customer Segmentation Analysis
Developed a clustering algorithm that identified 5 distinct customer segments, leading to a 23% increase in marketing campaign conversion rates. Used K-means clustering with PCA dimensionality reduction on customer transaction data.

#### Sales Forecasting Model
Built a time series forecasting model that predicted monthly sales with 94% accuracy. The model helped optimize inventory management, reducing storage costs by 17% while maintaining product availability.

#### Interactive COVID-19 Dashboard
Created a real-time dashboard visualizing pandemic trends across multiple regions. The dashboard was used by local health officials to make data-driven decisions about resource allocation.

#### Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews
Implemented an NLP model that automatically classified customer reviews by sentiment and key topics. Identified critical product issues two weeks earlier than manual methods, accelerating the product improvement cycle.
